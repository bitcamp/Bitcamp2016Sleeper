	<h3>The Quick Version</h3>
	<p>
		Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, marital status, physical appearance, veteran status, national origin, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any component of the event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online mediainteraction. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers.

		Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

		If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing an item of clothing to be designated at the time of the event. a colored bandanna on their person.

	<p>
		Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

	<br />
	<p>
We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop venues and event-related social events. We have a zero-tolerance policy on harassment. If you see anything that makes you uncomfortable or that you believe is making other hackers uncomfortable, you should disclose that to the event organizers in a responsible manner.
