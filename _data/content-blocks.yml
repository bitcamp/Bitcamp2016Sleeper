    - name: What is a Hackathon
      value: |
        A hackathon is a creative coding marathon. Students are encouraged to come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in 36 hours. For Bitcamp, we want you to take something you love (sports! art! camping!) and combine it with technology to make something awesome. It is a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.
